# Computer-Network-Sim
This was the final project for my data structures class in which I recode different structures in Java such as Hashmaps, Linked list, Arraylists to implementing Dkistras Algorithm. The main goal was to have different nodes(vertices) be able to communcate with one another via "Network" connections in which the shorts path is picked.
